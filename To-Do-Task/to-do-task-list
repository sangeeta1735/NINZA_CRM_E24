   Login to Ninza application , logout etc etc 
   
2. create suit file for group execution , batch execution , parallel execution , cross browser execution and 
   Run multiple scripts (for e.g. : CreateCampaignTest { multiple Test Scripts with different test cases }  , 
   CreateProductTest{ multiple Test Scripts with different test cases }   etc )   

3. Test Scripts with use of Assertion file changes and Run/Execute 

4. Listener class implementations 

5. By using Random number create test scripts to run different test cases  

6. Maven installation and run all the command to execute test scripts on command prompt by giving command line 




=============================== 


questions to ask : 

1. why with BaseClass extending not working and giving NullPointerException : Resolved 


2. what actually thread-count in DistributedParallelExecution suit file ? Ans.: each thread count will be responsible for executing each <test> tag 
in <suit> tag thread-count is must but in <test> tags thread-count="2" parallel="tests" are not mandatory but  name="Test1" is MUST 


3. thread-count should be same as test-runner (no. of <Test> tags ) ?? Ans. : Yes 

4. Edge Browser is not working in TestScript
